# Analysis on the BRFSS dataset
Focus Area: Data analysis & visualization (Python).
Based on annual surveys of 350,000 people the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System (BRFSS) dataset is compiled to assess emerging trends in public health and classify health-related risk behaviors.
For this project, I've sampled 20,000 cases and 9 variables to work with. My work will focus mainly on Data Visualization and drawing conclusions based on those visualizations.
