# Healthcare Habits Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is based on the annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey of 350,000 people to assess emerging trends in public health and classify health-related risk behaviors. For this project, I've sampled 20,000 cases and 9 variables. The main objective was to identify which habits/behaviors are most risky to people's health and how they're distributed over age and gender.

## Data Source
The data was obtained from the BRFSS [website](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm), which is a division of the CDC.

## Technologies Used
This project was implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The Python libraries used include Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Numpy.

## Process/Methodology
The project involved Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, and Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Results
The analysis identified key habits and behaviors that pose significant risks to people's health and provided insights into how these risks vary by age and gender.

## Learnings
Through this project, I learned how to visualize multi-variable relationships and perform exploratory data analysis.

## Future Work
In the future, I plan to enhance this project by incorporating machine learning algorithms.
    
    This project is based on Openintro Statistics (4th Ed.)
